# Encointer Protocol

The *Encointer protocol* is what ensures that
* only humans get a UBI
* every human can only get it once

We call the result of this protocol a *unique proof of personhood*.

Encointer leverages the fact that every person can only be in one place at one time. Every 10 days, participants are requested to attend physical key-signing meetups with small groups of random people. Because all meetups happen as one global ceremony all on the same day at the same local time, no one can attend two meetups.

The formal definition of the protocol can be found in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/encointer/whitepaper/raw/master/encointer_whitepaper.pdf)
