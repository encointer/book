# Support Us

The Encointer Association is a Swiss non-profit association. Please learn about [our constitution](https://encointer.org/about/)

There are plenty of ways how you can support us. The best way is by getting active and [engaging with your local community](https://encointer.org/partner-with-us/)

But we can also offer you more passive ways to support our mission:
* [Donations](./support-us-donate.md) if you want to give
* [Nominations](./support-us-nominate.md) if you want to earn staking rewards while helping us earn as well.
