# Bazaar

What is a local currency without the possibility to spend it on desired goods and services? How can you find businesses that accept the local Encointer currency? Encointer features a builtin classifieds system for advertizing businesses and offerings we call *bazaar*.

Anyone can register businesses and offerings to be advertized within their local community. All metadata and images for classifieds are stored on [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/). The ownership of classifieds is registered on the Encointer blockchain.

## Vouchers

Every business may issue their own transferrable vouchers and can therefore issue their own loyalty money or [acquire loans from the community](./economics-interest.md). As businesses are owned by real people whose digital personhood has been attested at Encointer ceremonies, these vouchers come with a sybil-defense and the credit rating of businesses is immutably recorded.
