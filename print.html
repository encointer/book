<p>This chapter shall be an opinionated interpretation of the status quo and what we expect to acheive with Encointer.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-cantillon-effect" id="the-cantillon-effect">The Cantillon Effect</a></h1>
<p>Richard Cantillon is known for his analysis on the effects of a change in money supply in a state on inequality. Around the year 1730 he wrote in his <em>Essay sur la nature du commerce en général</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the increase in actual money comes from the state's gold and silver mines, the mines' owner,  the entrepreneurs, the smelters, the refiners and generally all those who work in them will increase their expenditure in line with their gains. At home they will consume more meat and wine or beer than they used to, and they will become accustomed to having better clothes, finer linen, and more ornate houses and other sought-after commodities. Consequently they will give employment to some craftsmen who hitherto had not as much work and who, for the same reason will increase their expenditure. All if this increased expenditure on meat, wine, wool, and the like will necessarily reduce the share of other people  in the state who are not the initial beneficiaries from the wealth  of the mines in question. The bargaining in the market, with the demand for meat, wine, wool and the like being stronger than usual, will not fail to increase their prices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowadays, money supply isn't affected by mining gold and silver. It's the banks that issue money as credit - out of nothing. Translating Cantillon into our time, we should replace <em>miner</em> by <em>banker</em>. The rest of the story still applies. However, in spite of quantitative easing we don't see much price inflation for essential goods. This effect can be explained by observing that all this newly issued money never reaches the masses. </p>
<p>Encointer aims at inverting the <em>Cantillon Effect</em>. Instead of issuing money <em>at the top</em>, as credit to businesses and creditworthy individuals, we issue money <em>at the bottom</em>. Every individual gets a universal basic income: freshly issued money.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#universal-basic-income" id="universal-basic-income">Universal Basic Income</a></h1>
<p>A universal basic income (UBI) is a modest amount of money paid unconditionally to individuals on a regular basis (<a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/304/304706/basic-income/9780141985480.html">Standing</a>). Most advocates of UBI aim at introducing it at a national level, as a monthly income to all legal (fiscal) residents and paid out in cash (denominated in national currency). Usually, a UBI is suggested to be financed by some form of taxation. As <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674052284">Van Parijs &amp; Vanderborght</a> explain, a national UBI may lead to justice among thieves (achieving more equality within a wealthy nation while there’s staggering inequality globally). They therefore argue for a global UBI, as do <a href="http://www.worldbasicincome.org.uk/">WBI</a> or <a href="http://www.globalincome.org/">GBI</a>.</p>
<p>Encointer aims at providing a global UBI in terms of units of cryptocurrency created on a regular basis and distributed to individuals (almost) unconditionally. Let’s examine the characteristics of such an encointer-UBI:</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#universal" id="universal">universal</a></h2>
<p>Encointer is paid out to every human being able and willing to attend encointer meetus every 41 days and in posession of a smartphone. This unfortunately excludes persons with certain disabilities as well as those without a smartphone. Also, the need to travel to meetups comes at varying cost, depending on local population densities – a disadvantage to people living in remote areas. While this is not exactly unconditional, we think it is less exclusive on a global scale than introducing national UBI schemes in few wealthy nations. Moreover, encointer might promote the concept of UBI and pave the way for institutionalized national or global UBI.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#basic" id="basic">basic</a></h2>
<p>Nothing in the definition of UBI defines a specific amount. However, it is often understood to be sufficient to cover basic needs and therefore provide economic security to its beneficiaries. In order to do so, it should also be stable. Encointer is a new cryptocurrency with algorithmically defined monetary supply. Only the (global) market can define its purchasing power.
global vs local currency</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies based on public unpermissioned blockchains are global by nature. Encointer is such a cryptocurrency – with the important added feature of allowing local currencies to be issued, as will be discussed below. Encointer is paid out in equal nominal amounts to every individual. Technically, there is no decentralized way of doing otherwise as the P2P network has no awareness of national borders or the cost of living. As a means for UBI this is a mixed blessing. If UBI is expected to be suffient to cover basic needs there is no way to achieve this goal with a global currency. Purchasing power of one unit of global currency would vary hugely among different regions. The upside being that the UBI’s purchasing power is in that case expected to be higher in weaker economies, therefore reducing global inequality.</p>
<p>Because Encointer issuance involves meetups with known geolocation, it is technically feasible to issue local currencies which are algorithmically bound to high-interaction communities (though ignorant of national borders). This would allow the UBI to be denominated in a currency which is meant to be used within local ecosystems yet freely tradable globally.
real value</p>
<p>The purchasing power of a unit of local encointer currency is market-based. It isn’t backed by gold or trust in some nations central bank. It’s value is determined by its usefulness as a store of value, medium of transfer or unit of account. Depending on national circumstances, the usefulness of encointer can vary. Where large parts of the populations are unbanked, encointer could complement national currency because it is accessible to everyone and more convenient to use and store than cash.</p>
<p>Another angle from which to define value could be international development aid. Encointer would allow to distribute aid to individuals living in a specified area directly by buying their local currency. It would even be possible to buy such local currency at fixed rates, thereby ensuring a stable value of that local currency. Administrative cost and misappropriation of development aid could be reduced significantly.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#income" id="income">income</a></h2>
<p>Encointer delivers an income in a fixed nominal amount of digital currency, paid (or issued) in regular intervals (for every ceremony meetup attended, happening in fixed intervals of 41 days) to all participating individuals. This income is obligation free and is given to the rich and the poor alike.</p>
<p>This income is paid for by issuing money and therefore by nominal inflation of encointer currency. The absolute nominal inflation rate depends on the number of ceremony meetup participants. And there is a correcting factor: Demurrage!</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#demurrage" id="demurrage">Demurrage</a></h1>
<p>Encointer currencies feature <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency)">nominal demurrage</a>: All balances get devalued over time. The funds you’re holding lose 7% of their nominal value every month. Think of this devaluation like a payment to a solidarity fund that pays for the UBI. This way, Encointer can issue monthly UBI and still maintain stable money supply as shown by the simulation in the figure below. Another advantage of demurrage has been described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Gesell">Silvio Gesell</a> when he proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freigeld">Freigeld</a> in 1916: Demurrage increases money velocity, which in turn fuels the local economy.</p>
<p><img src="./fig/ubi-vs-demurrage-balance.svg" alt="demurrage" /></p>
<p><em>Money supply for a stationary economy with a demurrage fee of 7% per month and a population of 10’000 participants. After an initial phase, the UBI of 1 token per ceremony maintains a constant ratio to the total money supply and therefore maintains a constant real value.</em></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#comparison" id="comparison">Comparison</a></h2>
<p>Demurrage is mainly known as a means to increase money velocity. Known <a href="economics-local-currencies.html">local currencies</a> have chosen demurrage to be in the range of 2-8% per year.</p>
<p>Due to technical limitations, demurrage is often charged linearly, like 2% of the face value per quarter as in the case Chiemgauer, where demurrage is applied by stamping paper bills. Encointer has more technical freedom and charges <em>compound</em> demurrage, as a percentage of its current value. The difference between linear and compound demurrage becomes clear after 50 quarters: Your 100 Chiemgauer have cost 100€ in demurrage fees. With compound demurrage, your 100 Chiemgauer would still be worth</p>
<p>100€ * (1-0.02)^50 = 36.42€</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#local-currencies" id="local-currencies">Local Currencies</a></h1>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are fundamentally global in nature. Their networks are decentralized and agnostic to national borders. But global currencies have a severe disadvantage: Their purchase value can evolve very differently in different regions. The Euro is such an example, which is the official currency in many european countries with distinct fiscal policies and economic development. While there are political reasons to favor such a unifying currency, many economists doubt the concept. States with less economic growth have no option of devaluing their national currency. They can only get into debt - and then get forced into austerity, further weakening their economy.</p>
<p>Local currencies on the other hand are mainly affected by local economy. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#classification" id="classification">Classification</a></h2>
<p>Known examples of local currencies can be divided into <em>mutual credit</em>,  <em>local fiat currencies</em> and <em>time banks</em>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#mutual-credit" id="mutual-credit">Mutual Credit</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_credit">Mutual credit</a> is a membership based, cashless currency created by clearing positive and negative balances between members when they trade. Usually, the accounts are denominated in national currency.
If Alice provides a service worth 100$ to Bob, Alices balance will be +100$, Bob's will be -100$. Alice can later spend her 100$ balance in a trade with Charlie, who may be interested in a service Bob provides.
Businesses are often allowed to have negative balances in the order of their usual turnover for a few months. These schemes rely on a local authority that performs due diligence when accepting new members and bans defaulters.</p>
<p>Examples are barter networks like <em>Talent</em> or business exchange networks like <em>WIR</em>, <em>RES</em>.</p>
<p>Mutual credit usually comes with high transaction costs. You might not always find the product you are looking for and it may be challenging to accept such currency for payment if you don't know where to spend it later.</p>
<p>In an economic environment of deflation, when there is a shortage of money because banks are reluctant to issue credits, mutual credit has shown to be of great value [1]. But when there's an abundance of money, these networks are unattractive and they generally don't further Encointer's goal of reducing inequality.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#local-fiat-currencies" id="local-fiat-currencies">Local Fiat Currencies</a></h3>
<p>Currencies like Wörgl's AB Schein, Chiemgauer or Berkshares are denominated in national currency. Often they have circulating paper bills, sometimes featuring demurrage. What they all have in common: They are only circulating within a local community and are worthless elsewhere. Often, they are redeemable for national currency, sometimes subject to a small fee. Sometimes redemption is restricted to businesses.</p>
<p>On the bottom line, such currencies can be understood as a loyalty programme promoting local spending, sometimes incentivized with discounts. They are successful in strenghtening the spirit of local community [1] and they can mitigate unemployment in an environment of deflation (Wörgl). However, due to globalization, local goods are often more expensive than imported ones. Therefore, these currencies are not attractive for poorer members of the community if they have to buy the local currency with national currency in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/community-currencies">Grassroots Economics'</a> Sarafu Credit in Kenya is a very innovative approach that shows significant social impact by empowering poor neighbourhoods by issuing money to local businesses directly. However, their concept introduces complexity, as money supply and distribution so far relies on careful engineering by experts from outside the community, for each community specifically. Moreover, Sarafu Credit is backed by donation money. While this may resemble a cash-transfer scheme, it actually isn't: Foreign capital is used as a fractional reserve for the local currency by applying <a href="https://medium.com/linum-labs/intro-to-bonding-curves-and-shapes-bf326bc4e11a">bonding curves</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#time-banks" id="time-banks">Time Banks</a></h3>
<p>A very egalitarian category of local currencies are time banks. They proclaim that one hour's worth of service by one human has equal value to one hour's work by any other. Mostly, they work like mutual credit currencies, with the difference that the denomination is hours instead of national currency.</p>
<p>Examples are Blaengarw Time Centre, Dane County Time Bank</p>
<p>While the concept of time banks has shown to increase social capital [1], in practise they feature high transaction cost and liquid matchmaking showed to be challenging. The main benefactors end up to be the same individuals that also perform well on a free market based on national money. If your service is in high demand, you will be able collect more hours than you'll be able to spend on services you desire.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you ask me what is the worst thing in the world, I will say it is compound interest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>said Olusegun Obasanjo, president of Nigeria, in August 2000 after the G8 Okinawa summit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that we had borrowed up to 1985 or 1986 was around $5 billion and we have paid about $16 billion yet we are still being told that we owe about $28 billion. That $28 billion came about because of the injustice in the foreign creditors’ interest rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compound interest makes debt grow exponentially, but nothing in nature grows exponentially forever. Sooner or later there will always be a saturation effect (usually modeled with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-curve_(math)">S-curve</a>).</p>
<p>Even worse, our national money is <em>created</em> by commercial banks as credit, bearing compound interest. A priviledge for wealthy shareholders, which results in constantly growing debt and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_imperative#Monetary_system_and_the_role_of_positive_interest_rates">growth imperative</a>, an unsustainable way to design our economy.</p>
<p>Compound interest is also a major cause of inequality [1]. It ensures that rich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#alternatives" id="alternatives">Alternatives</a></h2>
<p>A Lender usually charges interest from the borrower. Besides giving the borrower an income, interest also covers opportunity costs and compensates for the risk of the borrower defaulting on the loan.</p>
<p>It is beneficial to society if members with capital they can spare for a limited period of time provide their assets to members who need capital to build a business or suffer a temporary shortage.</p>
<p>In a society with a lot of social capital, lenders often provide their assets without a monetary incentive (or do you charge interest when borrowing money to a friend?). But this way of social lending does not scale well to larger loans.</p>
<p>Mutual credit is a way to better scale social credit beyond bilateral agreements (See WIR, LETS, RES). Interest-free credit is issued by clearing positive and negative balances when members trade, denominated in national currency. (See <a href="./economics-local-currencies.html">local currencies</a>)</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#saving-is-no-virtue" id="saving-is-no-virtue">Saving Is No Virtue</a></h2>
<p>One of the main reasons we're saving is the fear that we might not be able to cover for our needs at some point in the future. UBI addresses this fear by promising a minimal unconditional income until our death. Insurance is another answer to this fear.</p>
<p>The act of accumulating capital is considered a main reason for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_imperative#Monetary_system_and_the_role_of_positive_interest_rates">growth imperative</a> by [2]. </p>
<p>Saving is also motivated by the desire to become wealthy and better off than others. This desire conflicts with Encointer's goals of reducing inequality.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, the design of Encointer disincentivizes saving in favor of spending or investing locally.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#encointers-approach" id="encointers-approach">Encointer's Approach</a></h2>
<p>Holding Encointer currencies comes at high opportunity costs because of <a href="./economics-demurrage.html">demurrage</a>. This is an incentive to spend or lend money at no interest. However, it may appear more attractive to exchange all perishable money you don't immediately need for other assets outside the encointer ecosystem (national currency, shares, bonds, crypto assets). This investor flight would decrease the real value of encointer currencies.</p>
<p>Encointer allows businesses the issuance of vouchers that are not subject to demurrage. Vouchers are a transferrable promise to deliver goods or services sometime in the future. If they are transferrable, vouchers are nothing less than self-issued money. Vouchers can be <em>valid after</em> a certain date and therefore become credit. This credit is paid back by goods and services, not by money.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/delidollar-offers-route-to-business-funding-1071370.html">story of the <em>Deli Dollar</em></a> tells us how vouchers can be credit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frank Tortoriello runs a deli in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. In 1989 he wanted to move to larger premises but the bank would not lend him the $4,500 he needed, so he simply printed his own money.
He did not forge dollar bills - he launched &quot;deli dollars&quot; which customers could buy for $8 and, at phased periods, cash in for $10 of food. He sold the lot in a month and raised $5,000. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="./fig/DeliDollar.jpg" alt="DeliDollar Bill" />
With these vouchers, investors pay 8$ today instead of 10$ at some defined point in the future. This discount pleases the human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference">time preference</a>. While this discount can be viewed as interest, it certainly isn't compound interest. It only applies once and its value is fixed. Still, it gives the investor an incentive to invest.</p>

<p>The <a href="./protocol.html">Encointer protocol</a> provides a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#what-is-a-verifiable-credential">verifiable credential</a> (VC) of digital personhood and uniqueness based on its unique-proof-of-personhood (uPoP). This VC is used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">sybil-attack</a> mitigation for <a href="./economics-ubi.html">Encointer's universal basic income</a>, but can also be useful for other use cases as described below.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#privacy-considerations" id="privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</a></h2>
<p>If one person could only maintain one online identity, this would cause massive harm to privacy and therefore to human freedom because information could be linked across all platforms where such an identity is used. </p>
<p>With Encointer, users may maintain different identities on different platforms. The Encointer uPoP VC can be used to ensure one human only maintains one ID on one specific platform.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#social-media-example" id="social-media-example">Social Media Example</a></h2>
<p>Let's assume a decentralized social media platform like <a href="https://subsocial.network/">subsocial</a> enforces all its users to maintain only one account per human and prevents sybil attack with Encointer uPoP.</p>
<p>Alice Smith registers on subsocial with an alter ego of Sophie Summers because she doesn't want her presence on subsocial to be easily linkable to her physical world identity. Upon registration, subsocial would send a challenge to Alice to provide a uPoP. This challenge includes </p>
<ul>
<li>a platform token identifying subsocial (must be unique for subsocial)</li>
<li>a timestamp (or at least a ceremony index)</li>
<li>a confidence threshold (like: <em>must prove attendance for N of the last M encointer ceremonies</em>)</li>
<li>a list of trusted community identifers (can be restricted to a region to also provide plausibility of location of residence) Encointer will itself attempt to maintain a <a href="ssi.html#Community-Web-of-Trust">web-of-trust score for communities</a> which can be referenced instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alice now requests her uPoP for subsocial from the Encointer platform. Encointer maintains a registry of attested attendance for all recent ceremonies. Alice is represented in this registry by changing pseudonyms for every ceremony. These pseudonyms are public keys and she now has to provide evidence that she knows all private keys for all pseudonyms she claims. </p>
<p>Given that Alice can prove attendance of the requested N of the last M ceremonies, Encointer provides a uPoP to be sent to subsocial in the form of a verifiable credential signed by one encointer-worker enclave's signing-key. Encointer then stores the subsocial platform token along with Alice's ceremony attendance attestations. Should Alice attempt to claim the same ceremony attendances again for another account on subsocial, Encointer would deny to provide a uPoP VC.</p>
<p>uPoP VC's need to be renewed over time because an adversary could register an additional account every few months otherwise.</p>
<p>Now imagine Sophie Summers becomes a victim of cyberbullying and Alice wants to drop that identity and create a new one under the name of Maria Gonzales. She will have to attend a few encointer ceremonies without claiming the attendance with subsocial. After a few months, she can register a new account on subsocial because she has collected enough unlinked evidence.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#community-web-of-trust" id="community-web-of-trust">Community Web of Trust</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="./protocol.html">Encointer protocol</a> builds communities based on trusted setups involving well-known people in every community. On a community level, this trusted setup is the root of trust. On a global level, these people may not be known nor trusted and communities will not trust each other blindly. Adversaries might maintain bot communities in the middle of the pacific. </p>
<p>Encointer can leverage an economic incentive to build a web-of-trust (WoT) among communities: Encointer issues local currencies. Communities that trade with each other will exchange their local currencies frequently in both directions on a decentralized exchange (DEX). Based on a few trusted seed communities that act as a root of trust (one per country, continent, world), the whole world may become linkable in a single WoT given geographically dense adoption of Encointer.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#polkadot-parachain-personhood-service" id="polkadot-parachain-personhood-service">Polkadot Parachain Personhood Service</a></h2>
<p>Should Encointer become a system chain, parachain or parathread of Polkadot, it could provide proofs of digital personhood to other parachains through cross-chain communication. As uPoP VC will be signed by SGX enclaves, a client parachain needs a trustelss way to query the enclave registry to verify a VC.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crosschain">XCMP</a> can be used to verify a certain enclave is registered as an encointer-worker and has passed remote attestation on the encointer platform.</p>

<p>The <em>Encointer protocol</em> is what ensures that</p>
<ul>
<li>only humans get a UBI</li>
<li>every human can only get it once</li>
</ul>
<p>We call the result of this protocol a <em>unique proof of personhood</em>.</p>
<p>Encointer leverages the fact that every person can only be in one place at one time. Every 41 days, participants are requested to attend physical key-signing meetups with small groups of random people. Because all meetups happen as one global ceremony all on the same day at the same local time, no one can attend two meetups.</p>

<li>D could be a real person colluding with C</li>
</ul>
<p>Probability:</p>

<li>low because of randomization if number of meetups assigned is high
<ul>
<li>evil.corp could redistribute sybil id's after meeting assignments, undermining randomization</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Mitigation: </p>
<ol>
<li>(NOK) track participant locations and require plausible movement trajectories before meetup. <strong>not sound</strong> because it is easy for C+D to spoof realistic trajectories</li>
<li>(NEEDED?) Quarantine: The validator can detect that the meetup is split and therefore not consistent. Issuance could be conditional to future ceremony attendance</li>
<li>(OK) The pair with higher reputation wins, the other doesn't get a reward issued.</li>
<li>(NOK) invalidate non-consistent meetups, preventing 2 illegit rewards while demoralizing 2 honest participants.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this meetup, 1/2 of registered participants are malicious.</p>

<p>As long as the threat model assumptions are held, we can find a set of rules that prevents:</p>
<ul>
<li>issuing more rewards than there are honest participants (while there is no guarantee that every honest participant will get a reward in face of malicious behaviour)</li>
</ul>
<p>The probability that you as a participant experience a meetup with evil majority follows the poisson cumulative distribution function:</p>
<p>Given the overall proportion of malicious actors , the probability that you (being an honest actor) will suffer from malicious behaviour at one specific meetup depending on the number of participants in your meetup <em>n</em> is</p>

<img src="./fig/probability_of_malicious_majority.svg" alt="" /></p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#decentralization" id="decentralization">Decentralization</a></h1>
<p>Decentralization can mean very different things and is never black and white but rather a goal that can never be fully achieved. Encointer aims at</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>architectural decentralization:</strong> avoid a single point of failure through redundancy (different machines in different geographic locations)</li>
<li><strong>political decentralization:</strong> distribute control among many individuals and organizations</li>
<li><strong>logical decentralization:</strong> ensure that the system can continue to exist if it is divided into arbitrary subgroups</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two are common for blockchains. Logical decentralization, however, isn't a feature of global blockchains. There may only be one truth globally. Encointer, on the other hand, can be split into its shards of local communities and continue to exist - with restrictions on finality and interoperability. This way, Encointer could even continue to exist in countries that eclipse their citizens from the internet or selective parts of it. At least temporarily.</p>
<p>Over all, <em>resilience</em> is what we aim for.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#blockchain" id="blockchain">Blockchain</a></h2>
<p>Why does Encointer need a blockchain? All the economic aspects could be implemented with a central server as well. </p>
<p>We develop the Encointer software with altruistic intentions. Still, Encointer may likely be judged as unlawful in certain juristictions and repression may follow. If a trusted entity would operate Encointer as a service, that system would be very vulnerable to states or other economically powerful entities.</p>
<p>P2P systems, including blockchains, have proven to be very resilient versus state intervention. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#consensus-and-security" id="consensus-and-security">Consensus and Security</a></h2>
<p>On Blockchains, code is law. This law needs to be secured against malicious attacks. While the security of the bitcoin blockchain is measured in mining hashpower, the security of PoS chains like Polkadot is measured in staked capital. Both approaches boild down to the simple rule: <em>the &quot;biggest&quot; blockchain is the most secure</em>.</p>
<p>As Encointer is no business case or speculative asset by design, it needs to rely on other things than capital or hashpower for security of consensus. </p>
<p>Thanks to its proof-of-personhood, Encointer could apply democratic consensus like described in <a href="http://bford.info/pub/dec/pop.pdf">PoPcoin</a>.
However, a web of trust would have to be established first.</p>
<p><a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> is a heterogeneous multi-chain system with shared security. While this approach reduces the amount of capital Encointer would have to bind for equal security, it still is a profoundly capitalistic system and competition around parachain slots may make it impossible for Encointer to become a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parachains">Polkadot parachain</a>. </p>
<p>While the final solution is yet to be discovered, Encointer will start off as a proof-of-authority (PoA) chain which is initially operated by trusted entities. The worker registry, however, will be permissionless. Anyone with a suitable TEE will be able to operate workers for communities of their choice.</p>
<p>Once possible, Encointer will attempt to become a parachain of Polakdot or Kusama by means of crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Should this fail, it can still get finality for its PoA consensus by running as a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parathreads">parathread</a> instead.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#governance" id="governance">Governance</a></h2>
<p>Encointer is no static system. It shall evolve over time and different communities shall be able to adjust their local rules independently. Such a foederalistic governance is possible thanks to Encointers' <a href="./ssi.html">self-sovereign identity (SSI) features</a>.  Encointer's proof-of-personhood allows to have democratic voting. Its proof-of-location ensures that people can only vote on matters concerning their local community. This local governance shall rule over the parameters of individual community currencies, such as defining meetup locations, changing the <a href="./economics-demurrage.html">demurrage rate</a>, changing the <a href="./economics-ubi.html">UBI</a> amount or the name of their currency.</p>
<p>Global governance shall leverage the <a href="./ssi.html#community-web-of-trust">web-of-trust among communities</a>. Democratic votes are thus weighted with the trust score of each community. Global governance shall decide on updates to the blockchain logic and global parameter such as the ceremony period, the set of trusted TEE manufacturers or the distribution of fees.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#privacy" id="privacy">Privacy</a></h2>
<p>Encointer protects its users' privacy by design:</p>
<ul>
<li>transfers of local community currencies are private by default. No one learns who sends how much to whom.</li>
<li>account balances of local community currencies are private (while aggregated values such as a community's total issuance and turnover are public)</li>
<li>ceremony meetup assignments are processed confidentially because that strenghtens the Encointer protocol by hindering collusion. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#philosophy" id="philosophy">Philosophy</a></h3>
<p>Privacy can also be a threat to communities. There is a good reason why most nation states enforce anti money laundering (AML) laws. Encointer aims to follow a simple rule: <strong>The smaller the amounts, the higher the privacy should be. And vice versa - the higher the amounts, the higher the transparency should be</strong>. This - unfortunately - is pretty much the opposite of what we experience in today's reality as big capital and gains can easily be offshored and obscured while everyday purchases are traced down to the penny.</p>
<p>As encointer is made up of many small communities - none of which will have a significant market capitalization on a global scale - it will never be easy to move great amounts of capital through these local currencies unnoticed. That's why Encointer simply is not an attractive channel for laundering money.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#testnets" id="testnets">Testnets</a></h1>
<p>Encointer maintains two testnets: Gesell and Cantillon.</p>
<p>The networks differ in their goals and designs:</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#gesell" id="gesell">Gesell</a></h2>
<p>Aimed at automated testing of the protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time-warping allows to script bot populations and hold ceremonies every 30min.</li>
<li>Complete transparency of all registries and balances. Everything happens on-chain.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#cantillon" id="cantillon">Cantillon</a></h2>
<p>The main purpose of Cantillon is to test our <a href="./app.html">mobile phone app</a> for physical meetups and to test privacy features.
Aimed at experimenting with real ceremony meetups, physically meeting people.
Bot communities can still be grown but we expect them to be loctated in off-shore locations in order not to interfere with physical communities. </p>
<ul>
<li>Accelerated ceremony schedule to avoid long wait times. Ceremonies every three days. <em>Temporarily, we will apply 30min ceremony cycle like Gesell</em></li>
<li>Privacy enhancement through Trusted Execution environments (with enclaves still in development mode, so privacy is not guaranteed before we move to production mode)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cantillon is planned to become a parachain to <a href="https://kusama.network/">Kusama</a></p>

<p>Now that we have some funds to pay platform fees, we can start our own local currency and bootstrap a bot population! 
Define Meetup Locations</p>
<p>First of all, we need to define in what region the currency shall be issued. For this we use the geojson standard to define a set of meetup places and add some meta-information about the currency. You can use geojson.io to select meetup places on a map (define a few &quot;Points&quot;). Make sure that you select places that are &gt;100m apart. You also need to keep this minimal distance from other registered currencies. You can list all registered currencies with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; nctr list-currencies
</code></pre>
<p>Our <a href="https://explorer.encointer.org">explorer</a> allows you to browse all regsitered currencies and their attributes on a map.</p>
<p>The number of locations that you should define depends on the size of the population N you'd like to bootstrap. As a rule of thumb, there should be at least N locations in order to guarantee reasonable randomization. As a maximum of 12 people can attend the same meetup the hard lower limit is N/12. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#trusted-setup" id="trusted-setup">Trusted Setup</a></h2>
<p>Every local currency needs a trusted setup. A trustworthy group of 3-12 local people will hold the bootstrapping ceremony publicly. These bootstrappers need to be defined in the metadata block:</p>

<p>The ceremony phase will change to ATTESTING before the date of the ceremony. </p>
<p>An encointer ceremony happens at high sun on the same day all over the world. This way, no single person can attend more than one meetup. At each meetup, participants attest each others personhood. For this testnet, however, we don't care about real time or physical presence as we're testing with bot communities. See <a href="./testnets.html#time-warping-for-testnets">Time Warping</a> to learn how the timing maps between mainnet and Gesell.</p>
<p>Our bot communities can perform meetups simply with the following lines. In later networks, a mobile app will be used (similar to what we demonstrated in PoC1).</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># each participant generates a claim of attendance including her vote on how many people N are actually physically present at that moment

<p>Now you have to wait for the ceremony phase to become REGISTERING. Then we can verify that our bootstrapping was successful and our bootstrappers have received their basic income issue on their accounts in units of the new currency (beware that we still use the alais including our cid. This means we're not querying ERT token balance, but the balnce in your new local currency). </p>

<p>Encointer Cantillon uses <em>workers</em> to confidentially process your calls inside TEEs. In order to use Encointer currencies, you will be interacting with <em>workers</em>. You can list all available workers as follows: </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; nctr list-workers
number of workers registered: 1
Enclave 1
   AccountId: 5FBFhWyBgXsz6CtFzbgxprEmrtRLaiQBBsFHvK32vUeqUT7k

   RA timestamp: 2020-11-11 07:59:31 UTC
   URL: 127.0.0.1:19944
</code></pre>
<p>We may see a few enclaves and now we have to know what is the most recent Encointer enclave version as identified by MRENCLAVE. We suggest that you use our node which listens at https://substratee03.scs.ch as you have configured above. The URL in the registry is misleading due to an open issue. You will always be able to identify our node by its public signing key: <code>5FBFhWyBgXsz6CtFzbgxprEmrtRLaiQBBsFHvK32vUeqUT7k</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">MRENCLAVE=3YM1AH5qdQAsh6BjYqDeYKQbuKgyDgNiSoFmqSUJTYvV
</code></pre>
<p>Now we'll connect to a worker and request some publicly available information on an existing currency (aggregated values from its confidential state)</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cid=7eLSZLSMShw4ju9GvuMmoVgeZxZimtvsGTSvLEdvcRqQ
nctr trusted info -m $MRENCLAVE --shard $cid
</code></pre>
<p>The query may be slow but you should see something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">Public information about currency 7eLSZLSMShw4ju9GvuMmoVgeZxZimtvsGTSvLEdvcRqQ

  meetup count: 0
  ceremony reward: 1
  location tolerance: 1000m
  time tolerance: 600000ms
</code></pre>
<p>If you get such a response that means that you are successfully talking to our worker. Don't worry about the contents too much for now.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#create-accounts" id="create-accounts">Create Accounts</a></h2>
<p>Now we'll create three <em>incognito</em> accounts for three virtual people that we will use for the remainder of the tutorial. In a real setting, every user will at least need one <em>public</em> and one <em>incognito</em> account but we'll use the same <em>public</em> account for all users for simplicity.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nctr trusted new-account -m $MRENCLAVE
nctr trusted new-account -m $MRENCLAVE
nctr trusted new-account -m $MRENCLAVE
</code></pre>
<p>This will create three accounts, in our case being these:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">5EcDWHsGzERpiP3ZBoFfceHpinBeifq5Lh1VnCkzxca9f9ex
5Dy4K5eNr13D37NcMcq4ffQZBAmt9BZhkgi5kBGuUWwK8cB7
5GCdWmdr5eZRvRPx6XE8YxFD472EvSMSTK6GQCHyuiNnw7rK
</code></pre>
<p>You can observe that a new keystore has been created in your working directory below <code>my_trusted_keystore</code>. </p>
<p><em>Incognito</em> keys do not need to be pre-funded as the Encointer STF does not charge fees. The underlying blockchain in fact does charge fees but for simplicity, our testnet client delegates all fee payments to Alice (with a well-known and hard-coded private key), who is very friendly and pays the fees for everyone. The Encointer Association will ensure that Alice doesn't run out of funds.</p>
<p>The CLI uses the keyword <em>trusted</em> for all calls involving <em>incognito</em> accounts. Under the hood this means that you're acutually interacting with a worker TEE. The blockchain is merely a proxy in this case, forwarding your request to the worker enclave. See <a href="https://www.substratee.com/design.html#indirect-invocation-current-implementation">indirect invocation</a> for in-depth documentation.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#bootstrap-your-own-currency-1" id="bootstrap-your-own-currency-1">Bootstrap your own currency</a></h2>
<p>Now we can start our own local currency and bootstrap a bot population with our three users! </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#define-meetup-locations" id="define-meetup-locations">Define Meetup Locations</a></h3>
<p>First of all, we need to define in what region the currency shall be issued. For this we use the geojson standard to define a set of meetup places and add some meta-information about the currency. You can use <a href="http://geojson.io">geojson.io</a> to select meetup places on a map (define one or a few &quot;Points&quot;). Make sure that you select places that are &gt;100m apart. You also need to keep this minimal distance from other registered currencies. You can list all registered currencies with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; nctr list-currencies
</code></pre>
<p>The number of locations that you should define depends on the size of the population N you'd like to bootstrap. As a rule of thumb, there should be at least N locations in order to guarantee reasonable randomization. As a maximum of 12 people can attend the same meetup the hard lower limit is N/12.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#trusted-setup-1" id="trusted-setup-1">Trusted Setup</a></h3>
<p>Every local currency needs a trusted setup.
A trustworthy group of 3-12 local people will hold the bootstrapping ceremony publicly.
These bootstrappers need to be defined in the metadata block.
For improved privacy, we will use our incognito accounts for this that will never be used on-chain.</p>
<p>Now we create our currency specification:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;FeatureCollection&quot;,
  &quot;currency_meta&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;my minimal test currency&quot;,
    &quot;bootstrappers&quot;: [
      &quot;5EcDWHsGzERpiP3ZBoFfceHpinBeifq5Lh1VnCkzxca9f9ex&quot;,
      &quot;5Dy4K5eNr13D37NcMcq4ffQZBAmt9BZhkgi5kBGuUWwK8cB7&quot;,
      &quot;5GCdWmdr5eZRvRPx6XE8YxFD472EvSMSTK6GQCHyuiNnw7rK&quot;
    ]
  },
  &quot;features&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;,
      &quot;properties&quot;: {},
      &quot;geometry&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;,
        &quot;coordinates&quot;: [
          11.25,
          40.03182061333687
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Replace bootstrappers with your newly created accounts and replace the Point with your location of choice. Then save the above to minimal.json and register your new currency. Currencies are registered in public on-chain, so we'll ask Alice to pay for the fees.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nctr new-currency minimal.json //Alice
</code></pre>
<p>Your currency has been registered on-chain and the return value is your currency-identifier (cid). Store the cid to an env variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">cid=HKKAHQhLbLy8b84u1UjnHX9Pqk4FXebzKgtqSt8EKsES
</code></pre>
<p>Let's check the registry again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; nctr list-currencies
number of currencies:  1
currency with cid HKKAHQhLbLy8b84u1UjnHX9Pqk4FXebzKgtqSt8EKsES
</code></pre>
<p>Cantillon features <a href="https://www.substratee.com/sharding.html">sharding</a> and every new currency will have its own shard. The CLI client allows you to use different accounts on different shards. For this tutorial we'd like to use exactly the same accounts that we just created for the default shard (identified by the mrenclave). So we need to link our sharded keystore to the default shard:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">cd my_trusted_keystore
ln -sd E9h2hi91jn8Y9taz3JynF82sLkaUREY13XAhRWeu1fiR HKKAHQhLbLy8b84u1UjnHX9Pqk4FXebzKgtqSt8EKsES
cd ..
</code></pre>
<p>Now we will be able to use our keys for the new currency.</p>
<p>In order to bootstrap your bot currency, You'll need to register all of them for the next ceremony during the 16h registering phase. You can only start this procedure every 3 days!</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#check if phase is REGISTERING
&gt; nctr get-phase

# ok, let's register, but first we will define a few variables and a new alias
&gt; account1=5EcDWHsGzERpiP3ZBoFfceHpinBeifq5Lh1VnCkzxca9f9ex
&gt; account2=5Dy4K5eNr13D37NcMcq4ffQZBAmt9BZhkgi5kBGuUWwK8cB7

# if everything goes well, you should be able to get your registration index &gt;0:
&gt; nctr trusted get-registration $account1 --mrenclave $MRENCLAVE --shard $cid
send TrustedGetter::get_registration for 5EcDWHsGzERpiP3ZBoFfceHpinBeifq5Lh1VnCkzxca9f9ex
Participant index: 1
</code></pre>
<p>The current client may throw an irrelevant error about decoding events. Just ignore that!</p>
<p>Now's a good time to check what public information is available about our currency at this time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt; nctr trusted info -m $MRENCLAVE --shard $cid
Public information about currency HKKAHQhLbLy8b84u1UjnHX9Pqk4FXebzKgtqSt8EKsES
  total issuance: 0
  participant count: undisclosed (might be REGISTERING phase?)
  meetup count: 0
  ceremony reward: 1
  location tolerance: 1000m
  time tolerance: 600000ms
</code></pre>
<p>So, right now, there is nothing to see. The participant count is deliberately undisclosed during REGISTERING to prevent information leakage about participants.</p>
<p>You'll have to wait until the ceremony phase turns to ASSIGNING. The worker enclave then assigns all participants to randomized groups that will have to meet at a random meetup locations at the upcoming ceremony.
During the ASSIGNING phase you can learn where and when exactly you will have to be for your meetup and how many people you're goint to meet. The CLI however, doesn't support that query. The <a href="./app.html">mobile phone app</a> does, however. There is publicly available information we can query on the CLI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt; nctr trusted info -m $MRENCLAVE --shard $cid
Public information about currency HKKAHQhLbLy8b84u1UjnHX9Pqk4FXebzKgtqSt8EKsES
  total issuance: 0
  participant count: 3
  meetup count: 1
  ceremony reward: 1
  location tolerance: 1000m
  time tolerance: 600000m
</code></pre>
<p>You can see your three participants have been assigned to one meetup. No money has ever been issued for this currency. Perfect.</p>
<p>The ceremony phase will change to ATTESTING on the date of the ceremony. The time of the ceremony will be high sun in your location. This way, no single person can attend more than one meetup. At each meetup, participants attest each others personhood. However, for a bot community this doesn't matter as they can jointly pretend to have met at the right time. (That's one of the reasons why we need a trusted <em>human</em> setup in the first place)</p>
<p>See <a href="./testnets.html#time-warping-for-testnets">Time Warping</a> to learn how the timing maps between mainnet and Cantillon.</p>
<p>Our bot communities can perform meetups simply with the following lines. In our next tutorial, we will explain how to perform real physical meetups with our mobile phone app.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Now you have to wait for the ceremony phase to become REGISTERING.
Then we can verify that our bootstrapping was successful and our bootstrappers
have received their basic income issue on their accounts in units of the new currency</p>

<p>Your new currency has a very special property called <a href="./economics-demurrage.html">demurrage</a>.
This means that the nominal value of your holdings decreases over time.
Currently it is halving every year.
You can observe this by waiting for a few blocks and checking your balance again.
Think of this demurrage like a solidarity fee that you pay to the decentralized &quot;state&quot;

<h1><a class="header" href="#bazaar" id="bazaar">Bazaar</a></h1>
<p>What is a local currency without the possibility to spend it on desired goods and services? How can you find shops that accept the local Encointer curreny? Encointer features a builtin classifieds system for advertizing shops and articles we call <em>bazaar</em>.</p>
<p>Anyone can register shops and articles to be advertized within their local community. All metadata and images for classifieds are stored on <a href="https://ipfs.io/">ipfs</a>. The ownership of classifieds is registered on the Encointer blockchain.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#vouchers" id="vouchers">Vouchers</a></h2>
<p>Every shop may issue their own transferrable vouchers and can therefore issue their own loyalty money or <a href="./economics-interest.html">acquire loans from the community</a>. As shops are owned by real people whose digital personhood has been attested at Encointer ceremonies, these vouchers come with a sybil-defense and the credit rating of shops is immutably recorded.</p>
